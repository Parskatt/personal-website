abstract = "Automatically identifying harmful content in video is an important task with a wide range of applications. However, there is a lack of professionally labeled open datasets available. In this work VidHarm, an open dataset of 3589 video clips from film trailers annotated by professionals, is presented. An analysis of the dataset is performed, revealing among other things the relation between clip and trailer level annotations. Audiovisual models are trained on the dataset and an in-depth study of modeling choices conducted. The results show that performance is greatly improved by combining the visual and audio modality, pre-training on large-scale video recognition datasets, and class balanced sampling. Lastly, biases of the trained models are investigated using discrimination probing."
